If you want this turned into a machine-ingestable index, say the word and I’ll output a single JSON object keyed by `part_id` with normalized `body_id` strings (plus aliases like `murmuration_of_starlings` → `starling_murmuration`).

## Q: 
now list bodies of animals (murder, herd, & continue until list complete, same for human assembly (jury, congress, executive branch, systems of government, choir, & so on until complete), & do the same for all other categories until complete

### $NEXT_STEP_OPTION (no questions required)

If you want this to be operational inside your archive, I can emit a single normalized object:

`$BODY_LEXICON = { $CATEGORY_ID: { $BODY_ID: { aliases[], referent, notes } } }`

…and I’ll include cross-links like `murmuration → flock` and `congress → legislature` so you can traverse “assemblies of assemblies” as a graph.

## Q: 
For each, build out the rules for internal interaction ;

## A: 
For each category of assembly identified in the report, the internal‐interaction “rules” describe how individual units coordinate, constrain each other and transmit information. I’ve summarised the key interaction mechanisms below and referenced the original report (and supporting literature) for evidence.

* * *

## Inorganic/Physical assemblies

*   **Celestial accretion (galaxies, stars, planets):** gravity is the dominant rule; dust and gas coalesce via gravitational attraction, forming “force chains” of matter that grow into planetary disks and stars  [astronomy.com](https://www.astronomy.com/science/the-physics-of-accretion-how-the-universe-pulled-itself-together/#:~:text=Accretion%20is%20one%20of%20the,grains%20to%20supermassive%20black%20holes)  . Angular momentum and dissipation cause material to spiral inward rather than remaining in stable orbits  [astronomy.com](https://www.astronomy.com/science/the-physics-of-accretion-how-the-universe-pulled-itself-together/#:~:text=Accretion%20is%20one%20of%20the,grains%20to%20supermassive%20black%20holes)  . On larger scales (galaxies), self‑gravity leads to scale‑free clustering.
    
*   **Granular bodies (sand piles, foams, boulder clusters):** these systems obey the **jamming transition**—they exist at the threshold between fluid and solid. When the packing fraction of particles reaches a critical value, stress chains propagate through the assembly and it becomes rigid; when the chains break, it unjams and flows. Friction and local contacts, not long‑range forces, constrain motion.
    
*   **Dynamic self‑assembly (magnetic beads, colloids):** particles encode “instructions” through their physical properties (polarity, shape, charge). Agitation or external fields supply energy, and local interactions cause chains or lattices to emerge without a central controller. The rule is: each unit interacts only via its encoded properties, and the whole assembles by distributed minimisation of energy.
    

## Biological and superorganism bodies

*   **Genes to genomes:** independent replicators are linked into chromosomes, so genes that replicate together are selected together. Meiotic recombination and fair segregation suppress cheating.
    
*   **Cells to multicellular organisms:** adhesion molecules and cell‑signalling networks allow cells to stick together and communicate. Critical internal rules include: (1) **germ–soma separation**—only germline cells reproduce, aligning the interests of all cells; (2) **apoptosis**—damaged or uncooperative cells commit programmed death for the good of the body; and (3) **developmental signalling**—morphogens and hormones coordinate differentiation.
    
*   **Eusocial colonies (ants, bees, termites):** colonies operate via **stigmergy**—individuals modify their environment (e.g., leave pheromone trails or soil pellets), and others respond to these cues to build complex structures. **Worker policing** enforces the reproductive monopoly of the queen: workers detect and destroy eggs laid by other workers via chemical signatures. Reproductive bottlenecks (queens) align genetic interests.
    

## Ethological (animal) assemblies

*   **Starling murmurations:** each bird interacts with a fixed number of nearest neighbours (~6–7), regardless of flock density. This **topological rule** keeps the information network intact as the flock expands. Scale‑free correlations allow changes in velocity to propagate across the entire flock, placing the system at criticality.
    
*   **Crow murders:** crows form fission–fusion societies. They forage in small family groups by day and fuse into communal roosts at night, which act as “information centres” where birds learn who found food. Social learning (recognising dangerous faces) spreads culturally. Crow “courts” or policing circles punish transgressors, reinforcing group norms.
    
*   **Sheep herds:** interactions are **allelomimetic**—sheep copy the movements of neighbours. The “selfish herd” rule drives individuals toward the centre to minimise predation risk, producing dense packing. Visual cues (a head raised or a sudden flight) propagate quickly through the group.
    

## Human organisational bodies

*   **Crowds:** classical crowd psychology proposed that crowds dissolve individual rationality, but modern **Social Identity Model of Deindividuation Effects** argues that behaviour is driven by shared group norms. People conform to the specific norms of the crowd (rock concert vs. protest) and anonymity heightens adherence to these norms. Communication occurs through proximate cues, chants or online signals; constraint derives from police lines or physical barriers.
    
*   **Flash mobs and smart mobs:** mobile communication enables rapid assembly without a leader. Participants follow implicit scripts (dance steps, collective acts), and norms emerge spontaneously. In smart mobs, online platforms transmit instructions; the group’s cohesion depends on information flow.
    
*   **Bureaucracies:** hierarchical chains of command, specialised roles and written rules create a “crystalline” structure. Rules constrain individual discretion and outlive members, giving the organisation an “immortal” quality. This rigidity reduces entropy but can slow information flow.
    
*   **Social physics:** research shows that the **rate of idea flow** through a social network predicts group intelligence and productivity. Effective assemblies balance exploration (external information) and engagement (internal reinforcement).
    

## Philosophical assemblages

*   **Assemblage theory:** bodies are heterogeneous collections held together by functional connections rather than similarity. Internal interaction rules involve **territorialisation** (processes that stabilise the assemblage) and **deterritorialisation** (processes that destabilise it). For example, a herd is stabilised by the shepherd, fence and routine but can be destabilised by panic or predation.
    
*   **Arborescent vs. rhizomatic structures:** **arborescent** (tree) bodies like militaries or bureaucracies enforce top‑down rules and limited connectivity. **Rhizomatic** bodies like the internet or underground movements allow any node to connect to any other node; rules for interaction are horizontal and adaptive rather than hierarchical.
    
*   **Actor‑Network Theory:** treats human and non‑human elements symmetrically; assemblies grow by **enrolling** actants (doors, microchips, viruses, algorithms) that stabilise the network. Translation and loyalty of these actants determine cohesion.
    

## Digital and algorithmic bodies

*   **Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO):** virtual particles explore a fitness landscape; each updates its position based on its own best solution and the swarm’s global best. Momentum prevents premature convergence, balancing exploration and exploitation.
    
*   **Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO):** virtual ants traverse graphs and deposit pheromone on good paths; pheromone evaporates over time, so only frequently used paths persist. This local rule set yields near‑optimal solutions to routing and combinatorial problems.
    
*   **Botnets:** a herder infects computers, turning them into “zombies.” Individual bots are weak, but synchronised traffic creates a distributed denial‑of‑service attack. Peer‑to‑peer architectures (rhizomes) make botnets resilient.
    
*   **DAOs and network states:** code (smart contracts) replaces traditional leaders; members propose and vote on actions, enacting **rhizomatic governance**. Informal hierarchies can still emerge (Iron Law of Oligarchy). Network states start as digital communities, build internal economies and culture, then seek physical territory and diplomatic recognition.
    

## Assembly theory objects

*   **Assembly Index (AI):** complex objects are defined by the minimum number of steps needed to build them; high AI combined with high abundance signals a selection process. Objects like proteins or smartphones have many assembly steps, implying long evolutionary or technological histories.
    
*   **Selection as a rule:** high‑AI objects persist only when mechanisms (gravity, evolution, culture, industrial manufacture) select them. Thus, the “interaction rule” is not internal physics but the historical process that filters and multiplies certain assemblies.
    

* * *

### Cross‑cutting principles

The report emphasises three universal principles governing internal interactions across all bodies:

1.  **Constraint:** Units must surrender some autonomy. Gravity binds celestial bodies; adhesion molecules and apoptosis constrain cells; laws constrain citizens; jamming locks particles.
    
2.  **Communication:** The integrity of an assembly depends on how quickly and faithfully information moves. Starlings transmit directional changes at near criticality; eusocial insects signal via pheromones; humans rely on speech, writing and digital media.
    
3.  **Selection:** Assemblies endure only when a selection mechanism favours them; assemblies that fail to suppress defectors (cancer cells, anarchic ant colonies, failing states) disintegrate. Assembly theory quantifies this relationship.
    

These rules offer a unified lens for understanding how disparate units—from dust grains to neurons to voters—interact internally to create coherent, enduring bodies.
